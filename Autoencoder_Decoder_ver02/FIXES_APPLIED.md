# 🔧 Training Failure Fixes Applied

## Problems Found & Fixed

### 1. ❌ Missing `dataset_ivf.py` in submit file
**Problem**: `train.py` imports `dataset_ivf`, but it wasn't being transferred to the job.

**Fix**: Added `dataset_ivf.py` to `transfer_input_files` in `train_h200_lab.sub`

### 2. ❌ Missing `build_index.py` in submit file
**Problem**: `run_train.sh` tries to run `build_index.py` to create `index.csv`, but the file wasn't transferred.

**Fix**: Added `build_index.py` to `transfer_input_files` in `train_h200_lab.sub`

### 3. ❌ `build_index.py` had hardcoded local path
**Problem**: Original `build_index.py` used `/Users/grnho/Desktop/Project IVF/embryo_dataset` which doesn't exist on CHTC.

**Fix**: Created CHTC-compatible `build_index.py` that uses `Path("data")` (the symlink created by `run_train.sh`)

### 4. ❌ `run_train.sh` exited on error
**Problem**: `set -e` caused script to exit immediately when training failed, preventing `results.tgz` from being created.

**Fix**: 
- Removed `set -e`
- Added `|| echo "Training failed..."` to training command
- Added `export PYTHONPATH="$PWD:$PYTHONPATH"` so `dataset_ivf.py` can be imported

## Files Updated

1. ✅ `train_h200_lab.sub` - Added `dataset_ivf.py` and `build_index.py` to transfer list
2. ✅ `run_train.sh` - Fixed error handling and PYTHONPATH
3. ✅ `build_index.py` - Created CHTC-compatible version using relative `data` path

## Next Steps on CHTC

1. **Upload the fixed files**:
   ```bash
   cd ~/ivf_train
   # Copy updated files from GitHub or upload manually
   ```

2. **Resubmit the job**:
   ```bash
   condor_submit train_h200_lab.sub
   condor_q
   ```

3. **Monitor the job**:
   ```bash
   condor_tail 2650510.0  # Replace with your new job ID
   # Or
   tail -f logs/train_XXXX_0.out
   ```

## Expected Behavior Now

1. ✅ Dependencies install successfully
2. ✅ `data` symlink created → `/project/bhaskar_group/ivf`
3. ✅ `build_index.py` runs and creates `index.csv` (if needed)
4. ✅ `dataset_ivf.py` is found via PYTHONPATH
5. ✅ Training starts successfully
6. ✅ `results.tgz` is always created (even if training fails)

## If Training Still Fails

Check the error log:
```bash
cat logs/train_XXXX_0.err
tail -n 100 logs/train_XXXX_0.out
```

Common remaining issues:
- Data path `/project/bhaskar_group/ivf` doesn't exist or has wrong structure
- CUDA out of memory (reduce batch_size)
- Missing data files
