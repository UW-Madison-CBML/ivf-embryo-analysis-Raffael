### **Option 1: Stay with 128x128** ⭐ **Recommended for now**

**Pros:**
- ✅ Faster iteration (test ideas quickly)
- ✅ Lower risk (proven to work)
- ✅ Can train multiple seeds/configs
- ✅ 128x128 is often sufficient for temporal dynamics

**Cons:**
- ❌ Lower spatial detail

**When to use:**

- Final production model
- When spatial detail is critical

---

### **Option 3: Hybrid Approach** 🎯 **Best of both worlds**

1. **Phase 1**: Train at 128x128 (fast iteration)
   - Validate architecture
   - Tune hyperparameters
   - Test different loss functions

2. **Phase 2**: Fine-tune at 512x512 (high quality)
   - Start from 128x128 checkpoint
   - Transfer learning approach
   - Faster convergence

## 🔧 Implementation Changes Needed for 512x512

### 1. Model Architecture Changes

**Encoder** - Need 2 more downsampling layers:
```python
# Current: 128 → 64 → 32 → 16 (3 layers)
# New: 512 → 256 → 128 → 64 → 32 → 16 (5 layers)
```

**Decoder** - Need 2 more upsampling layers:
```python
# Current: 16 → 32 → 64 → 128 (3 layers)
# New: 16 → 32 → 64 → 128 → 256 → 512 (5 layers)
```

### 2. Training Configuration

```python
# Reduce batch_size to fit in memory
batch_size = 4  # or 6 (instead of 8)

# May need to adjust learning rate
learning_rate = 2e-4  # Slightly lower for stability
```

### 3. Dataset Loading

```python
# In dataset_ivf.py
resize = 512  # instead of 128
```

## 💡 My Recommendation

**Start with 128x128, then upgrade to 512x512 for final model.**

**Reasoning:**
1. **Faster iteration**: You can test 4-6 different configurations in the time it takes to train one 512x512 model
2. **Lower risk**: Validate everything works first
3. **Transfer learning**: You can later fine-tune from 128x128 → 512x512 (much faster than training from scratch)
4. **H200 advantage**: Once you have a good 128x128 model, you can run multiple 512x512 experiments in parallel

**Timeline:**
- **Week 1-2**: Train and validate at 128x128
- **Week 3**: Fine-tune best model to 512x512
- **Result**: High-quality model in ~3 weeks instead of 3-4 weeks
